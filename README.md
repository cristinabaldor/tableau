# tableau

This Tableau workbook uses citibike data from all of 2020. I used python to combine all of the data into one csv, which I then connected as my data source in tableau.

Through data exploration, I found two variables that had interesting differences. The first was the variability in terms of which bikes and which stations were most often utilized, which I've visualized in a map. Larger circles indicated a higher number of the 19.6 million rides in 2020 starting at that location. The map also allows you to toggle on and off months to see which stations are more popular as the months go by.

My dashboards dive a bit deeper into the data. The first creates a heatmap of the bikes that have the most mileage, and the top ten stations in the city for starting or ending a citibike ride. Unsurprisingly, they are the same ten stations.

The second dashboard breaks down ridership by gender and by subscription status. The analysis shows that the vast majority of citibike riders are male and subscription holders. Women use citibike less often, and are much more likely to be casual day users than subscribers. Across genders, day customers spend about twice as long on their bikes as subscribers.
